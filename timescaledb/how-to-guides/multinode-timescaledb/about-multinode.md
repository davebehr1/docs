# About multinode
If you have a larger workload, you might need more than one TimescaleDB
instance. TimescaleDB multinode allows you to run and manage multiple instances,
giving you faster data ingest, and more responsive and efficient queries.

You can use multinode on a self-managed TimescaleDB instance, or you can use it
on [Timescale Cloud][multinode-cloud] or
[Managed Service for TimescaleDB][multinode-mst].

This section contains instructions to set up a self-managed cluster, including
configuring the nodes for secure communication and creating users and roles
across servers.


[multinode-cloud]: timescale-cloud/:currentVersion:/cloud-multi-node
