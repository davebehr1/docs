# Psql Basics

Psql is the terminal-based front end to PostgreSQL, and is the primary tool used
to communicate with your TimescaleDB instances. Below is a refresher on some essential
psql commands that you may come across in our documentation, and will find useful
as you explore PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB.

For an in-depth breakdown of all commands, visit [psql's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html).

## Connections

* Connect to a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB server via psql (using parameter flags)

```bash
psql -h host_name -p port -U username -W -d database_name
```

* Connect to a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB server via psql (using a service URL)

```bash
psql "your_service_URL"
```

* Show your psql version
```bash
psql --version
```

## Functions

Edit a function

```bash
\ef function_name
```

Display all functions

```bash
\df
```

Display all functions with more details (including owner, source code, and description)
```bash
\df+
```

## Views

List views from current schema

```bash
\dv
```

List views from all schemas
```bash
\dv+
```

## Users

Display PostgreSQL database roles
```bash
\du
```

Reset the password for a PostrgreSQL database user
```bash
\password username
```

## Indexes and Extensions

List all indexes from all tables

```bash
\di
```

Show all extensions installed
```bash
\dx
```

## Import and Export CSV
The following commands can be used to import csv files and export csv files from your PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB database.

<terminal>

<tab label="Import">

```
\copy table_name FROM '/path/to/data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

</tab>

<tab label="Export">

```
\copy (SELECT * FROM table_name) TO 'output_file.csv' WITH CSV HEADER

```

</tab>

</terminal>

## Backup and Restore

Note: the following commands utilize the pg_dump tool and pg_dumpall tools.

Create a backup for a specific database in plan-text SQL script file
   (with default backup options)

```
pg_dump database_name > database_name.bak.sql
```

Creates a backup for a specific database in plan-text SQL script file (with customized backup options)

```
pg_dump -c -C -F p -f database_name.bak.sql database_name
```

Run pg_dump on a client computer to back up data on a remote Postgres server

```
pg_dump -h remote_host -p port -U user -f database_name.bak mydb
```

Backup all databases along with database roles and cluster-wide information

```
pg_dumpall > alldb.bak.sql
```

Restore the database plain-text backup generated by pg_dump or pg_dumpall

```
psql -U username -f filename.sql
```

Restore the database custom-archive backup (.bak)

```
pg_restore -d database_name /path/to/your/file/database_name.bak -c -U database_user
```
